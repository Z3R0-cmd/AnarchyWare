# Old AnarchyWare source code

Yes. You heard it right. So many flipping ppl got this bc some of my dev's were idiots (Not u, Q_Q)

So since every1 already has this old client it might as well be public. come and skid this, idc. :/

Also:
Yes i used an online decompiler bc i don't need to give u an eclipse ready product. If you want to skid this you have to figure that out.
